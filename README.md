# QueensBoard ![build](https://github.com/Anh-KNguyen/QueensBoard/workflows/Build%20and%20Deploy/badge.svg)

A web application that generates a random permutation of 8 chess queens and arranges them in a way so that no two queens attack one another. Avoids placing two queens in the same row, column, or diagonal.

Implemented with backtracking. ðŸ‘‘ðŸ–¤ The application was deployed to a Digital Ocean instance in the cloud.
